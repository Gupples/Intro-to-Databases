    Team activity; baggies with parts of traffic signs among all the different teams.
    Data out of context makes no sense. 
    Data is the new oil; it's where the money is.

    Data-based decision-making. Some tools;
        Geospatial;
            www.arcgis.com and Living Atlas are good examples of Data
        Economics
            .csv files, tableau, Power BI
    Activity using Living Atlas; General questions to consider when looking at a 
    database;
        -How is this data useful?
        -How can it help us make data-driven decisions?
        -Can it make money?
        -Is it Ethical?
    An effective method of being productive is time-boxing*.
    
    *Box out some time to dedicate to a single task and stick to it, eg; homework,
        classes, food, etc.

    Power consistency and Data Consistency. 
        -You can keep data consitent by forcing a type of data to be a string instead
            of a number or requiring a cell to be a number. Databases are great because
            you can force rows and columns to require certain data types to keep
            consistency.
        -SQL & MYSQL; SQL = Sequence Query Language. MySQL = ...
        -SOW = Statement of Work.
        -Entity is a thing you can keep a record on/of. If you're talking about a single
            one fo those, that is an "instance" of an entity.
        -IN SQL; "SELECT * FROM person
                     WHERE last_name = "Peterson";" is how you can get all the people in a
                database with the last name of Peterson. We're gonna learn more about that
                later in the semester. Subject to change slightly between databases.
    -Data Redundancy
        -Redundancy in data is bad. We want to get rid of it all. Eg; if a store's database
            says a single person buys milk on a regular basis, that would FILL the database,
            so we most likely will move that to be its own database. 
        -When writing relationships between databases, use the following to indicate them
            (in this example, read it only going to the right);
            Many; [Person]--<[Order]
            One; [Order]----[Person]

    When using datatypes for your database, CHAR(2) uses less memory than VARCHAR(2), so use
    CHAR for smaller variables. CHAR will keep all the values that you enter in, even if you
    don't use the rest. "cherry" takes as much memory as "_ _ _ R _". VARCHAR cuts off after 
    you're done, but it takes a little memory to keep track of where it cut off.
    If you wanted to do a more strict data type, use ENUM(). For
    that, specify the only values in declaration.
    (eg. strictname; ENUM('ID', 'UT', 'AZ', 'WA',...)). NOTE; IT DOES NOT automatically
    make it available in the overall program you might be writing in. You still would
    need to program it into your website's dropdown selector, for example.
    For more data types, visit https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_datatypes.asp
    In class, we will use;
        -INT        -BOOLEAN        -TINYINT
        -CHAR       -VARCHAR        -DATE
        -DATETIME   -YEAR           -DECIMAL
        -ENUM
    DECIMAL requires 2 inputs; a size and a display number. Eg. DECIMAL(6,2) would mean
        "show '_ _ _ _ . _ _'". DECIMAL(8,3) would be "show '_ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _'".

    BOOLEAN (16-bits) takes more space than TINYINT (8-bits)

    NORMALIZATION - Used to make sure each column in the database is relevant/used correctly.
    1st- The Key
        Does it have a primary key?
    2nd- The whole key
        Does the entire record depend on the primary key?
    3rd- Nothing but the key
        Does it have columns that doesn't depend on the primary key?

    INT(4) DOES NOT LIMIT IT TO 4 CHARACTERS!!! It only limits the DISPLAY to the 4th place, eg. 
    345678 would round to 3457.

    SINGLE QUOTES ARE BETTER IN DATABASES because single quotes are universal across databases; double quotes are NOT.
    If you use double quotes in your database, you're putting your database in danger because of incompatability between
    servers.
